name=Adjust Syle 
qgisMinimumVersion=3.16
description=Experimental QGIS Plugin to adjust the style of a map with a few clicks 
    instead of altering every single symbol for many categories or a number of label rules. 
    It offers a quick way to adjust the style of all vector layers (or selected layers) in a 
    consistant way, to check out how different colors / stroke widths / fonts work for a 
    project, or to apply styles of one project to another one. 
    It allows to: adjust color of all symbols (including color ramps and any number of symbol layers) 
    and labels using the HSV color model (rotate hue, change saturation and value); 
    change line thickness (i.e. stroke width of all symbols / symbol borders);
    change font size of all labels;
    replace a font family used in labels with another font family;
    save / load the styles of all layers at once into/from a given folder.
